    <h2>OCT 2005 - JUN 2011</h2>
    <h3>UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX: DPHIL PHYSICS (INFORMATICS)</h3>
    <h4>Final Project:</h4>
    Project Aim: Investigate the applicability of 1-D Petschek-type
    magnetohydrodynamic models to (CLUSTER II) in-situ multi-spacecraft observations
    of plasma parameters in dayside magnetopause reconnection events.
    Computational Modelling: Using MATLAB to prepare data before selecting and
    composing reconnection layer structures using genetic algorithms for high-resolution, multi-variate time series data
    from four satellites across multiple event case studies.
    Analysis: Classifying events in terms of location, layer structure, flow and energy profiles, and fitness of the
    model.


    <h2>OCT 2005 - JUN 2011</h2>
    <h3>UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX: MSC PHYSICS</h3>
    <h4>Final Project:</h4>
    Project Aim: The analysis and interpretation of single satellite (AMPTE-IRM) in-situ measurements of plasma
    parameters during dayside magnetopause transition events in terms of magnetohydrodynamic reconnection theory.
    Computational Modelling: Using MATLAB to prepare and explore data to identify evidence of candidate transition
    events. Selected candidates underwent a combination of manual and computational analysis to confirm signatures of
    reconnection. Identified reconnection events were modelled and analysed as a series of case studies.
    Analysis: Events were classified in terms of likelihood of reconnection, type, layer structure, and energy profiles.
